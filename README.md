# Red 2
Red 2 is a card game similar to "Dou Di Zhu" (Fight the Landlord), but played with four players. Unlike Dou Di Zhu, which uses a single deck of cards, Red 2 uses two decks of cards, with all four jokers removed. Each player starts with 26 cards. Players are divided into two teams based on whether they have the Red 2 of hearts (♥2). The team with the Red 2 aims to win by playing all their cards first, following rules similar to Dou Di Zhu. Here are the details:

## Card Playing Rules
+ A bomb is formed by four or more cards of the same value, e.g., five 3s, six Queens, four Kings, etc. A pair of Red 2s forms the strongest bomb, capable of beating any other card combination, including other bombs. A bomb beats any other hand type, including other bombs, as long as its value is higher. For example, four Queens are stronger than four 10s.
+ A single Red 2 is stronger than a regular 2. The hierarchy is Red 2 > regular 2 > A > K > Q > J > 10 ... > 3.
+ Straight: A minimum of six consecutive cards is required (in Dou Di Zhu, it’s five cards).
+ Pairs: Two cards of the same value, like 66 or AA.
+ Three with one: Three cards of the same value with one extra card (e.g., 555 + 8).
+ Three with two: Three cards of the same value with a pair (e.g., 555 + 88).
+ Plane: Two or more sets of three with one or three with two (e.g., 555666 + 89 or JJJQQQ + 33, 55).
+ Consecutive pairs: A minimum of three consecutive pairs (e.g., 334455).
Note: Singles, pairs, three with one, three with two, consecutive pairs, and straights can only be beaten by the same card type. However, a bomb can beat any card combination.

## Gameplay
+ After dealing the cards, the system randomly selects a player to try and claim both Red 2 cards. If the chosen player has the Red 2 of hearts (♥2), they must give it up, entering into a 1VS3 mode (one player with both Red 2s versus the other three). Whichever side has a player finish their cards first wins. There are no draws.
+ Alternatively, players may decide to play a normal 2VS2 mode, meaning no one claims both Red 2s. In this case, the game follows an order of players finishing their cards: the first player earns 4 points, the second earns 3, the third earns 2, and the last earns 1 point. The team with the highest total points wins.
+ If no one claims the Red 2 bomb, but one player holds both Red 2s, they can either give one Red 2 to their teammate, clearly dividing the teams, or they can keep both to play a secret match. In the secret match, the player with both Red 2s can sow discord among the other three players, playing in stealth. The game outcome follows the 1v3 rule.
+ If one player has only one Red 2, the game is played in the 2VS2 mode. If a player gives up one Red 2 to their teammate, it becomes a team game, where everyone knows their teammates and opponents. Otherwise, the identities of the teams remain hidden, and players must deduce their allies during the game.
